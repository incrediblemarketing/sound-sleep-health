### Sync ACF Fields
This theme comes packaged with several pre-built custom Field Groups via ACF Pro. After activating incredibletheme and Advanced Custom Fields Pro, these fields are automatically imported, **however if you edit any of them without syncing first, it treats your edits as NEW fields resulting in duplication issues**.

To avoid this, **sync the existing field groups before changing any fields**:
1. Go to Custom Fields
2. Click Sync available
3. Check all field groups
4. Select Bulk Actions > Sync
5. Click Apply

At this point you should have `incredibletheme` installed with all custom field groups imported and synced. Moving forward you should be able to edit anything you want without issue.

The Gulp tools in this build allow you to use sass, imagemin, js min/concat and js/css linters for errors. CSS media queries are also combinded for shorter code. Follow the steps below to get started!
